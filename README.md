# About

Dockerized nodejs container.

## Kafka UI

Visit http://127.0.0.1:3030 to inspect your kafka broker, topics, partitions etc.

## Sub Project

If you have a project in angular then checkout angular. Delete all those folders which you do not need. Update the package.json on root.

OR

git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <github_url> <foldername>

Then delete the .git folder. Then go with git init.

Same with react.

For example if your project does not need elastic search then delete esdata. If your app does not need mysql then delete mysql. Same with the mobile app.
